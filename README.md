# README Generator

## Description

This application allows users to generate professional README documents using prompts entered within the terminal, allowing more time to be spent actually coding! During the design of this application, I learned how to work with the 'inquirer' and 'fs' packages within the node.js environment to dynamically generate files.

## Installation

Before running 'node index.js' in the terminal, make sure you have installed inquirer at version 8.2.4. Run 'npm i inquirer@8.2.4' if you have not already done so.

## Usage

Navigate to the repository in the terminal. Then, run 'node index.js' and answer the prompts. Upon completion, a README will be generated in the 'md' directory.
